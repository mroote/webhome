### 3D Printing is a powerful tool for building many kinds of projects

It has become an indispensible tool for designing and creating objects in the real world.  Using 3D printing along with CAD software allows the creation of complex objects or tools. The ability to design a part in the computer and have a printer create it in hours is something that I really enjoy and use extensively.

Not only is 3D printing a powerful tool for creation it has created large communities online of people sharing their creations and experiences.

I currently use an Ender 3 with some modifications I've either designed or found online created by others.

Currently I do most of my designs in FreeCAD, it is powerful software with a clunky interface. Blender is another option I use when creating parts that don't need exact dimensions. I try and stick to open source design tools after running into limitations with commercial CAD software like OnShape and Fusion 360.

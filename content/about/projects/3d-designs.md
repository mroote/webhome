### [Ender 3 Fysetc F6 Case](https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/tool/ender-3-fysetc-f6-case)

![Ender 3 Fysetc F6 Case](IMG_0031_large.JPG)

### [Ender 3 Side Spool Mount](https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/tool/ender-3-side-spool-mount)

![Ender 3 Side Spool Mount](IMG_0158_large.JPG)

Side spool mount for the Ender-3 filament holder. Moves the filament spool holder to the side of the printer and moves the roll to be parallel with the Y axis. You may need to use some PTFE tubing and route the filament path with clips to keep the filament moving smoothly.

### [Ender-3 Filament Waste Squeegee](https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/tool/ender-3-filament-waste-squeegee)

![Ender-3 Filament Waste Squeegee](ezgif.com-optimize2_large.gif)

After modifying my Ender-3 to be direct drive I found the X axis had a bit of extra range to the side of the bed. Using this space I designed a waste tray and squeegee to make priming the nozzle a quick and clean process. No longer will you have to remove the extra plastic lines on the print bed from priming the nozzle. 

### [Ender-3 Display Offset Mount](https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/tool/ender-3-display-offset-mount)

![Ender-3 Display Offset Mount](IMG_0181_large.JPG)

Offsets the display from the frame of the Ender-3 in order to accommodate a waste filament tray.

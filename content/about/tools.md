As someone who enjoys creation in the physical and digital realms tools are a very important part of my work.

I am an advocate for using free and open source software whenever possible. Open source is the best way to keep your work your own and prevent losing access to the tool or end creation.

I try and choose my tools as something that will last and that I have full control over.
